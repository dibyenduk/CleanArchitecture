# Clean Architecture

## Introduction
---

Clean Architecture is a book by author Robert Martin. It defines patterns to structure classes and components within your code so that they are easy to change, maintain and deploy. The source code in this repository here is my take or attempt to implement the same.

Vertical Slice Architecture is another architecture written by Jimmy Bogard. I had the opportunity to work with Jimmy on a project and learn a lot about this architecture from him.

I like the approaches in both the patterns and hence this my attempt to combine them and pick up the theorotical aspect from Clean architecture and the implementation aspect from Vertical slice architecture while maintaining the abstraction and layer approach talked about in Clean architecture book.

For this example, I have selected a manufacturing execution system. This is a system used in manufacturing to track and document the transformation of raw materials to finished goods. MES works in real time to enable the control of multiple elements of the production process (e.g. inputs, outputs, personnel, machines and support services)
